# Vibecode Test Project

This repository is a sandbox for experimenting with **vibe coding**.  
The goal is to practice the workflow where natural language + AI code editors = functional applications.  

## What is Vibe Coding?
A method of building software by describing intent in natural language and letting AI handle implementation details. First coined by Andrej Karpathy in 2025, vibe coding emphasizes clarity of vision, structured communication with AI, and iterative refinement.

## Fundamentals of Vibe Coding

1. **Thinking**  
   Break ideas down across four levels:  
   - Logical (what is it?)  
   - Analytical (how does it work?)  
   - Computational (how does it map to code structures?)  
   - Procedural (how to make it excellent?).  
   Translate this thinking into a clear PRD before prompting AI.

2. **Frameworks**  
   Point the AI toward proven tools. Specify libraries, frameworks, or packages to avoid generic or weak solutions. Example: React + Tailwind for UI, FastAPI for backend.

3. **Checkpoints**  
   Always use version control. Adopt `git` + GitHub workflow: init, add, commit, push. Save incremental states so experiments donâ€™t erase progress.

4. **Debugging**  
   Expect failure. Identify errors, copy error messages, and give them to AI. Be methodical. Provide file context and suggest likely fixes. Iterate until stable.

5. **Context**  
   More context = better results. Supply requirements, mockups, error logs, environment details, and examples. Specific prompts prevent vague code.

## Project Setup
This test repo will contain simple apps built by vibe coding:
- Small PRDs
- Generated prototypes
- Debugging iterations
- Versioned experiments

## How to Use
1. Clone repo:
